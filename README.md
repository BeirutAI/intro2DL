# intro2DL

The key advancement in the field of artificial intelligence is Neural Networks, yet most people don’t understand how they really work!

Join us on 13th of June to demystify the black box of Neural Networks and break them into bits and pieces. We’ll start by defining Deep Learning and then explain its basic unit, Neural Networks: what are they, what’s the intuition behind them, why now, how they learn, etc.

This is a technical workshop, so expect to get your hands dirty with Python. You will build your first Neural Network using the most common deep learning framework, TensorFlow.

We will solve two Examples:

### 1st Example: Regression (Boston House Prices Prediction)
This example builds a model to predict the median price of homes in a Boston suburb during the mid-1970s. To do this, we'll provide the model with some data points about the suburb, such as the crime rate and the local property tax rate.

### 2nd Example: Classification (Fashion MNIST)
We train a neural network model to classify images of clothing, like sneakers and shirts.
